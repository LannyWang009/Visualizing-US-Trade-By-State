# Visualizing-US-Trade-By-State

> This is the final project for the [DigitalCrafts Flex Class](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/). The project was to build a web application as a group and we decided to use the skills we acquired through the DigitalCrafts flex course to learn a new programming language - D3. We then executed our project using D3 and built a dashboard visualizing U.S. trade data.

## Project Description

This project features a web-based data dashboard visualizing trade data by state. It was built using d3.js and is powered by data from the U.S. Census Bureau, specifically the Import and Export Merchandise trade statistics. 

Our web application provides an interactive view of the trade activity each state is engaged in, aimed at giving insight into what commodities states are trading as well as who their top trade partners are. We looked at these statistics across a 5 year period from 2014 - 2018.
